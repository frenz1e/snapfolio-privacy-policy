    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 11, 2026</p>

    <p>SnapFolio.AI ("App", "we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p><strong>Information stored locally on your device:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Portfolio data (assets, quantities, purchase prices) that you enter or import</li>
      <li>App preferences and settings</li>
      <li>Reminder configurations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is stored exclusively on your device using local storage (SQLite) and is never transmitted to our servers.</p>

    <p><strong>Information processed temporarily:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Images you capture or select for AI-based asset recognition are sent to third-party AI services (Google Gemini) for processing. These images are processed in real-time and are not stored by us.</li>
      <li>Asset symbols may be sent to financial data APIs to retrieve current market prices.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Subscription information:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Subscription status is managed by Apple through RevenueCat SDK. We receive anonymized subscription status information but do not have access to your payment details.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information described above to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and maintain the App's functionality</li>
      <li>Process AI-based asset recognition from images</li>
      <li>Display current market prices for your assets</li>
      <li>Generate portfolio insights and risk analysis</li>
      <li>Manage your subscription status</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your portfolio data is stored locally on your device and is not backed up to any cloud service by us. We recommend using your device's built-in backup features (e.g., iCloud Backup) to protect against data loss.</p>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical measures to protect the information processed through the App, but no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> — Subscription management. <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RevenueCat Privacy Policy</a></li>
      <li><strong>Google Gemini API</strong> — AI-powered asset recognition from images. Images are sent for processing and are subject to <a href="https://ai.google.dev/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's API Terms</a></li>
      <li><strong>Financial data APIs</strong> — Market price data retrieval</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We only share information as described in the Third-Party Services section above, which is necessary for the App to function.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since your data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it. You can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Delete any or all portfolio data within the App</li>
      <li>Delete the App entirely, which removes all locally stored data</li>
      <li>Manage your subscription through Apple's subscription management</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
